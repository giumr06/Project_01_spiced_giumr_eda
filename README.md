# Introduction:

- Here you will find my first solo E.D.A project was proposed during the Data Science boot camp from Spiced Academy (08.2023). 

- This project was proposed as a brief introduction to the E.D.A topic.

- The goal here is to have a superficial analysis of the provided data using Python language.

- Last update: 11.09.2023. No changes in the structure or previous content of the original project. Changes were mostly made to improve the understanding of the notebook itself.

# The project structure: 

This folder contains two notebooks with project tasks given in the [assignment](assignment.md).

- The first notebook contains the [Task 01](project_task_01_giumr.ipynb) where 3 insights about the chosen data set. Providing a more descriptive analysis of the processes involved in the exercise. Using the explanations provided in the ["Fetching the data"](Fetching_the_data_ead.ipynb)

- The second notebook contains the [Customer service analysis](project_client_giumr.ipynb). It's the main part of the project where we have to select and analyze the right amount of the given data set to provide 3 good recommendations for a client of our choice, according to the list. For this project, the chosen customer  was Nicole Johnson.

- You can find everything used to create this project's virtual environment in the [requirements](requirements.txt). 

- The based data set can be found in the folder data that is included already in the repository for this project.

- The [column descriptions](column_names.md) can also be found in this repository, in case the categories used for creating and analyzing the data are unclear. You will find there an explanation of the meaning of each category present in the original data sets.
